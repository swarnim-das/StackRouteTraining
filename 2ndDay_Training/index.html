                    The number of web applications being created and used has grown rapidly since the new millenium. And importantly, so has
                    the sheer complexity of them -- specially on the front end. No more static pages, no sir!

                    You have a ton of sections each interacting with each other and the server and yes, it's as complicated as it sounds and
                    just as hard to pull off. Today, I'd like to talk about a few choice JavaScript frameworks that aim to
                    simplify front-end application development.
